# [ftrpg](https://dmellogu.github.io/ftrpg/)

A fantasy tactical role-playing game made with Phaser3 (WIP). There is a lot of progress to be made, but I'll do my best to keep the deployment "playable." It can be played [here](https://dmellogu.github.io/ftrpg/).


## How to Play

You can navigate the world by either double clicking on a tile or dragging. Select a character by double clicking on them. Once selected, double click another tile to move them there.
